## Branches

ADK Go uses two long-lived branches:

-   **`main`** — the actively developed 2.x line. This is the default branch and
    the base for new pull requests.
-   **`v1`** — the maintenance branch for the 1.x line. Target this branch only
    for fixes that need to ship to 1.x.

The `v1` branch is a snapshot of the 1.x line, branched from `main` before the
2.0 work landed. `main` then continued forward as the 2.x line (the 2.0 release
was merged into it), so its history is unbroken — old clones fast-forward
cleanly. There is no need to re-sync or rename anything locally:

```bash
git switch main
git pull            # fast-forwards onto the 2.x line
```

To work on a 1.x fix, base your branch on `v1`:

```bash
git switch -c my-fix origin/v1
```

## Multi-Module Development

**Policy**: New integrations with heavy or optional dependencies must be created as separate Go modules.

**Local Development**: Contributors should use `go work init && go work use -r .` to set up their local workspaces.

**Steps to Add a New Module (e.g., `plugin/myplugin`)**:
1. Navigate into the directory: `cd <module_directory_path>`
2. Initialize the module: `go mod init google.golang.org/adk/<module_directory_path>`
3. Add your Go code, dependencies, and tests.
4. Tidy the module: `go mod tidy`
5. Return to the repo root.
6. Tidy the root module: `go mod tidy`
7. Add the module to your workspace: `go work use ./<module_directory_path>`
8. Verify everything builds and tests from the root: `go build work && go test work`. The CI will automatically pick up the new module on the PR.

**Release Tagging**:
- **Core Module**: Tags remain `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v2.1.0`).
- **Submodules**: Tags are prefixed with the full module path directory, e.g., `plugin/agentanalytics/v0.1.0`. This is the standard Go way to version modules not at the repo root.
- **go get / go install**: Consumers will use:
  - `go get google.golang.org/adk/v2@v2.1.0`
  - `go get google.golang.org/adk/plugin/agentanalytics@v0.1.0`
- **Version Coupling**: Each submodule's `go.mod` will specify the minimum version of `google.golang.org/adk/v2` it depends on. Submodules can be released independently of the core module and each other.
- **go.work Impact**: `go.work` is for local development only and does not affect how modules are versioned, tagged, or fetched by consumers.

**Cutting a core release**:

The core version lives in `internal/version/version.go` as `const Version`, and
must match the release tag. Two workflows keep it in sync so the bump is never
forgotten:

1. Run **Actions → Release** (`release.yml`) with the target version (e.g.
   `2.1.0`). It bumps the constant, commits it directly to `main`, and opens a
   **draft** GitHub Release pinned to that commit. The direct push needs
   `github-actions[bot]` on the `main` ruleset's bypass list if `main` is
   protected. Only maintainers listed as **required reviewers** on the `release`
   environment can approve the run, and it must be dispatched from `main`.
2. Review the draft release notes in the Releases UI and click **Publish**. Only
   then is the tag `vX.Y.Z` created — on the pinned bump commit.
3. On publish, **Version check** (`version-check.yml`) verifies the constant at
   the tagged commit equals the tag and fails the release run if it does not.

Locally, `.github/scripts/version.sh get` and `... set X.Y.Z` read and write the
constant; the checks skip submodule tags (`plugin/.../vX.Y.Z`).

### Sign our Contributor License Agreement

All submissions to this project need to follow Google’s [Contributor
License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.developers.google.com/about), which
covers any original work of authorship included in the submission. This
doesn't prohibit the use of coding assistance tools, including tool-,
AI-, or machine-generated code, as long as these submissions abide by the
CLA's requirements.

You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply
gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the
project.

If you or your current employer have already signed the Google CLA (even if it
was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

Visit <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements or to
sign a new one.

### Review our community guidelines

This project follows
[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Contribution workflow

### Finding Issues to Work On

-   Browse issues labeled **`good first issue`** (newcomer-friendly) or **`help
    wanted`** (general contributions).
-   For other issues, please kindly ask before contributing to avoid
    duplication.

### Requirement for PRs

-   Code must follow [Google Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/index).
-   All PRs, other than small documentation or typo fixes, should have an Issue
    associated. If a relevant issue doesn't exist, please create one first or
    you may instead describe the bug or feature directly within the PR
    description, following the structure of our issue templates.
-   Small, focused PRs. Keep changes minimal—one concern per PR.
-   For bug fixes or features, please provide logs or screenshots after the fix
    is applied to help reviewers better understand the fix.
-   Please include a `testing plan` section in your PR to talk about how you
    will test. This will save time for PR review. See `Testing Requirements`
    section for more details.

### Large or Complex Changes

For substantial features or architectural revisions:

-   Open an Issue First: Outline your proposal, including design considerations
    and impact.
-   Gather Feedback: Discuss with maintainers and the community to ensure
    alignment and avoid duplicate work.

### Testing Requirements

To maintain code quality and prevent regressions, all code changes must include
comprehensive tests and verifiable end-to-end (E2E) evidence.

#### Unit Tests

Please add or update unit tests for your change.

Requirements for unit tests:

-   Cover new features, edge cases, error conditions, and typical
    use cases.
-   Fast and isolated.
-   Written clearly with descriptive names.
-   Free of external dependencies (use mocks or fixtures as needed).
-   Aim for high readability and maintainability; include comments for complex
    scenarios.

#### Manual End-to-End (E2E) Tests

Manual E2E tests ensure integrated flows work as intended. Your tests should
cover all scenarios. Sometimes, it's also good to ensure relevant functionality
is not impacted.

Depending on your change:

-   **ADK Web:**

    -   Capture and attach relevant screenshots demonstrating the UI/UX changes
        or outputs.
    -   Label screenshots clearly in your PR description.

-   **Runner:**

    -   Provide testing setup. For example, the agent definition, and the
        runner setup.
    -   Include the command used and console output showing test results.
    -   Highlight sections of the log that directly relate to your change.

# ADK Web

## Updating ADK web version to latest

-   Run `./scripts/adk-web/update-adk-web.sh` to update the web UI to the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/google/adk-web).
-   Run `docker run -it adk-web-builder:latest sh -c "<COMMAND>"` to start the container and debug the build, e.g.:
    -   `docker run -it adk-web-builder:latest sh -c "ls -alh dist/agent_framework_web/browser"` to view the built files.
    -   `docker run -it adk-web-builder:latest sh -c "npm run build"` to debug the build output.

### Documentation

For any changes that impact user-facing documentation (guides, API reference,
tutorials), please open a PR in the
[adk-docs](https://github.com/google/adk-docs) repository to update the relevant
parts before or alongside your code PR.

### Alignment with adk-python
We lean on [adk-python](https://github.com/google/adk-python) for being the source of truth and one should refer to adk-python for validation.
